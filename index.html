      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am Sagar Patel and I am proud father of 2 girls.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from India. Now, I reside in Lenexa, Kansas.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>
        I was having lot of hobbies prior to my babies born but now I have just
        one hobby- play with them.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>
        My dream was actually to be a successful independent business owner but
        I could not purchase a business due to some family responsibilities. But
        now my dream is to be a successful developer.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Lenexa, KS.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>
        As a Software QA, I work daily with Developers and I just thought to be
        a developer. I always ran away from coding and automation but whenever I
        tried to find other jobs, all needed at least basic knowledge of some
        programming. So I forced myself to learn some programming and be a
        developer.
